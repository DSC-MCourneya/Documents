# Playing in Kokiri Forest
### Session Opener
> The Lost Woods encompasses a base expanse along the eastern border of Hyrule. These woods are composed of the Guardian Trees -- ancient standing figures that shroud those deemed unworthy from entering. These trees are the final form of the Koroks, a childlike race of beings that are vaguely humanoid and whose bodies are made of wood and leaf. The Guardian Trees are all interconnected, speaking a language that only the trees know, operating as extensions of the Great Deku Tree -- the father of the forest children, the Kokiri. Those children living in Kokiri Forest are protected from the outside world and allows them to cast aside their worries and focus on play and interaction with each other. Children of all races can be Kokiri. Eventually, each Kokiri child receives a fairy -- the mark of the beginning of their growth into eternal youth. For the magic of the forest eventually turns all Kokiri into Koroks.

##### The Dream
> You hear the clacking of hooves against stone as it echoes unnervingly in an otherwise dark silence. For a moment, there is nothing else, before the hooves are replaced with crackling flame and a heat that makes it hard to breathe. Bright red and yellow billow all around you, though you cannot see any flames. Unsure of what to do next, you attempt to flee. The hooves begin again, growing louder and louder behind you as your run. The heat and dancing lights grow more intense with each passing moment. Just then, you fall face-down and scramble to flip over and look up. A black horse stands over you, its rider a tall figure of dancing shadows. Piercing red eyes stare down at you from the figure as it reaches out toward you. You sit up abruptly in your bed, cold sweat racing down the back of your neck. The same dream, again.

### Kokiri Games
Today is the day of the *Kokiri Games*, an event held semi-regularly by the Kokiri children. **Mido** is of course the reigning champion of the games, earning him, by his own admission, the position of *Head Kokiri*. In truth, the games are just about fun. Kokiri alternate between running shops and games, and playing and taking part.

Today, it is your turn to take part in the games. **Saria** calls you over as you head outside, hoping to play some games with you.

##### Games
**Deku Nut Toss**: Toss *Deku Nuts* from the counter toward roughly carved wooden cups. If the *Deku Nut* lands in the cup and doesn't bounce out, you earn a point. You get five tosses and if you get three or more points, you get a stamp on your *Kokiri Games Stamp Card*.
- Use *Agility* to attempt tosses, unless player wants to use a different skill that makes sense
