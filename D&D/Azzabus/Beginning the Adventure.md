### The Party Setup
> The group begins the adventure aboard the *Enbridge III* operating various tasks on the ship. The airship is bound for Shorna for the wedding between the Teskavold and Featherwords families of Kastron and Tairnia, respectively. Cielennen Featherwords, Fyr'danai, and several of the elven wedding party are aboard the airship.

- **Dimsyl** is a guest of honor as an ex-gladiator held in high regard in the city of Shorna. He was invited to give his blessing upon the newlywed couple after they exchange their vows.
- **Fyr'danai Savad** is in charge of overseeing the ceremony as a high priestess of  Synvalla.
- **Fairchild** is traveling with Fyr'danai as a friend and plus one.
- **Smolma** is aboard the airship as first mate to *Captain Jack* of the *Enbridge III*.
- **Umryn Luckyflight** is aboard the airship as a chief technical officer of the *Enbridge III*.

#### The Airship
> Unlike her previous iterations, the *Enbridge III* is a mark of prowess for the heart of Kastron. Borrowing a mix of magic and technology from both the heart of Shorna and the distant capital of Veilspire, the *Enbridge III* has taken to the skies over one hundred times and not once had an issue with flight.

Allow the players a few minutes to introduce themselves to each other and the NPCs as needed. Once initial RP begins to die down, the airship jerks abruptly and begins emitting a high-pitched wail, though it continues to fly. If the party investigates, they find that one of the arcane flight cylinders is burnt out, though the other two are fine. They also find a Steam Kobold hiding in the underbelly of the ship. Once it is obvious he is caught, the kobold begins calling for backup, and the deck is swarmed with 7 other Steam Kobolds.  The kobolds are attempting to steal the flight technology, as their rickety flight packs are not nearly as reliable.
