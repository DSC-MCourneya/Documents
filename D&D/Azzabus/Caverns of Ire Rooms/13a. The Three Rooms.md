There are three doors at the north-side of the Pillar Room.

The eastern and western ones both open to small chambers with gold items and two uncommon-quality magic items. The third door opens to reveal a green goblin face, matching the one at the Entrance Hall. This face will suck up any hero that ventures too close and spit them out in the entrance hall. This face is not active until the heroes finish the Throne Puzzle.
