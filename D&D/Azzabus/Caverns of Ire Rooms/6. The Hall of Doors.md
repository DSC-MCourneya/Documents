This hallways has three doors that all must be lockpicked or broken down to proceed. This leads to another hallway that has an unlocked door at its far end. Stepping through this door simply results in the players stepping into the Entrance Hall, emerging from the Misty Door in the south-eastern corner.

The real exit is actually a hidden doorway just past the third door in the hall, along the southern wall. Inspection of this section will reveal a single brick that appears to not rest flush against the wall. Pushing the stone will make the particular section of wall ethereal, revealing a path do another small hallway. This hallways also has a hidden door, but the brick used to open it is in Room 7.  To reach Room 7, players must descend a set of stairs into a green mist. Entering the green mist triggers a Constituation saving throw DC 12. If the roll is failed, the player becomes Poisoned.

This hallway is referenced in the tome that the players can receive at the entrance of the dungeon.

> Beyond the beggar's hand is a hall of three and one -- but a deft hand will find the secret hidden in the stone beyond a thrice impeded advance. Another lies beyond that will see you escape unscathed, though further depths will elude you.
