Description:
> The door opens itself once your hand touches its knob, revealing a room of broken furniture and hanging tapestries, though the imagery on them is long faded. Resting on a sofa opposite the doorway is *Ciphel Orgus* with the *Staff of Unsung Sorrows* in hand. He smirks as you enter the room, rising to his feet and tapping the staff's end. He lunges forward, letting only a primal roar escape his mouth.

The tome has no text for this room.

Entering this room immediately begins combat. The *Ciphel* in this room is a Mirrorbody, which shatters, along with the mirror in the back of the room upon his defeat.
