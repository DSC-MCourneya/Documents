Description:
> You step through the shattered mirror into a small hallway. This hall leads to a stairwell, which in turn leads to a much larger hallways. The chamber is deathly silent and unlit.

Tome Text:
> At the cross hall -- two mirrors face each other though cannot see through the darkness. Should their way be lit, they will reveal between themselves which is the proper way. In darkness, only a fool would trust either one.

The players must light the wall sconces between the mirrors on the north and south side of the hallway. When all sconces are lit, the mirrors both reveal Mirrorbody creatures of whichever two heroes roll lowest on the Wisdom check. Once defeated, the mirror on the north side shatters, and the image in the mirror on the southside shows a different hallway, acting as a teleport to Room 12.

There is another doorway on the eastern side of the room which must either be lockpicked or broken down. It leads to a sandy chamber (Room 11).
