There tome text for this room:
> Be at rest and confide within -- though the path forward is hidden amongst the stone of this chamber. Half a minute is all you have to reach the other side, though through the mist you must hurry.

Description:
> You come into a room with burnt furniture scattered about the walls. In the center of the small room is a soft-looking loveseat. On the southern wall, you can see a brick protruding from the wall in an odd manner, similar to the one previously, but this one much more obvious.

Players can see an obvious brick on the southern side of the room that can be pressed, similar to the previous puzzle. However, the door will resume its solid state after 30 seconds, meaning that players that can move 30ft per round must Run to make it back to the doorway in time. If the players make no attempt to prepare for having to run through the green mist, they must make a new save when running through, but at a disadvantage. If they make preparations, such as donning a mask or other way, they may roll with Advantage as they sprint through the room.
