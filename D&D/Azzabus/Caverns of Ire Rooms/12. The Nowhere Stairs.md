Tome Text:
> At the base of the nowhere stairs is a set of three -- wood, silver, and gold. Though each one leads one closer to the same destination. Search closely at your journey's beginning and the answer will find you.

There is a false wall next to the entrance of this room. Once the heroes have stepped through the reflection, the wall behind them remains solid, trapping them in this room. The false wall leads to a tunnel, which leads to Room 13.
