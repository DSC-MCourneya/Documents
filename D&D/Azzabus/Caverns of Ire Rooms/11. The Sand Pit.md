Description:
> Stepping through the doorway, you immediately find a descending tunnel that changes from stone to sand. Emerging from the tunnel you find a large cavernous room with a sand for flooring. A strong light enters the room through a large hole in the ceiling, roughly 40ft above. In the center of the room is a rock face with a small, nestling area carved out. Inside, you can see a small wooden chest.

Tome Text for this room:
> Beware the chest buried in sand -- its keeper is not one to forgive or forget. The beast has dwelled within this stone longer than the time of Dragons and knows only the pursuit of those in its ire.

Retrieving the chest does not trigger anything immediately, but does give the party the *Pursued* status effect. As long as the party continues to keep the chest in their possession, Shadows will appear throughout their adventure going onward.

The chest itself is magically sealed and affixed with several paper charms.
