Description: 
> You come to a room with three wells, with working tables scattered around them. Each of the three wells has a liquid of different color: one black, one green, and one red. The room is otherwise lined with pots against the walls and nestled in corners. The walls are painted in murals of various torture methods, though the paint is faded by time in most areas.

The Tome Entry for this room:
> The three pools are maintained by the keeper below -- wielding the flail with a glee only found in the mind of Man. Three times in his back the blade of a survivor must come to rest so that he may escape this prison.

The players must find the image of a torturer wielding a flail, found in the southwestern corner of the room, and stab into it three times with a dagger or other bladed weapon. Upon the third stab, the wall will scream and fade into a hallway entrance.

Stepping into the room within 10ft of any of the pools awakens the Tentacle Lash inside. These creatures can attack anything within 10ft of them.  At minimum, the one from teh black pool must be killed to successfully take the time to open the doorway.
