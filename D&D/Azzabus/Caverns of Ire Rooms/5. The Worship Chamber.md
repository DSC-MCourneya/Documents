> You come through the tunnel into a room that is decorated like the inside of a place of worship. Several benches are affixed to the ground, facing southward toward an elevated area with a podium and sitting chair. To the southwest, you can see a room that glows as though a bright flame is lit inside.

This room has a second exit in the southeastern corner, hidden away as a small slit in the wall. The hole lines up with a weathered painting on that wall, where the hole is aligned with the hand of a beggar. Dropping a copper piece into the beggar's hand will cause the door to open up, reavealing a hallway behind. Any other coin dropped into the slot will simply be consumed.

The tome text for this room:
> Give not to those who have nothing the wealth of class -- be there hearts too frail to keep hold of it and their minds too fraught to fight the temptation of greed. So be it, then, that they take only a small offering and through that lead way to greater depths of soul.

Laid in front of the glowing room is a smoldering body. If a player attempts to enter the glowing room, they are immediately overcome by 6d6 fire damage and cast out of the room with such force that they land 20ft away.
