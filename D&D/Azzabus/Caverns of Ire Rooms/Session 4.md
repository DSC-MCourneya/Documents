#### Stumbling Upon the Camp
The players can enter the Kastron military camp willingly or be captured if they fail their Wisdom (Survival) check DC 15 when traveling through the latter portion of the Bluemist Mountains. This will land them in the Military Camp scene, whereupon they meet Knight Captain Roberts, the lead expedition commander in an ongoing conflict against *Ciphel Orgus*. He is reluctant to have non-humans in his encampment, and offers them a deal to avoid execution for illegal border crossing in exchange for their participation in an excursion into the *Caverns of Ire*, where they are hoping to flush out the black dragon. This entire scene can be skipped if the party is successful at evading the group or defeats the capturing party (2d6 Warriors).

From Knight Captain Roberts, the party can learn a few things:
- *Ciphel Orgus* was last seen fleeing into the *Caverns of Ire*, which is a long-known stronghold of his at *Cobalt Point* on the northern edge of Kastron.
- *Ciphel* has been instigating attacks against various military strongholds in Kastron as of late, leading the providence to rely on more powerful magicks that require wizarding towers and techniques imported from Lex Arcana.
- Particularly astute characers that pass a Wisdom (Perception) check DC 17 notice that Knight Captain Roberts' scale mail is crafted from black dragonhide. If pushed about it, he merely claims that if black dragons are going to side with *Ciphel* and be slain in the process, then their bodies should be put to use for the greater good.

#### Caverns of Ire
> You come upon Cobalt Point, its shores glimmering a bright blue as they crash along the coast. The glow is visible during midday, but by nightfall it acts as a powerful illumination against the otherwise imposing darkness cast by the Bluemist Mountains on this hidden shore. 
> As you travel along the coast, you come upon the entrance to the *Caverns of Ire*, otherwise hidden in the bramble of the coast's cliffs by vines and moss that cover the rock's face. A central entrance sits before you, a dragon's gaping maw etched into the stone, though time has withered away much of the detail. On either side of the maw is a smaller entrance, each nestled amonst pointed stones and carvings made to look like the open claws.

Either side of the central entrance are exits only, tied to various portals and traps contained within the Caverns. Attempting to go through the doors on the inside of those smaller caverns simply leads to the cavern on the other side.
