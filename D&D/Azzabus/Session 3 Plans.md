#### Flight of the *Enbridge III*
> The *Enbridge III* takes flight due north-northwest from Shorna. The *Caverns of Ire* are *Ciphel Orgus*' last known hideout and may contain information needed to pursue him. The party consists of *Fyr'danai*, *Umryn*, *Poppy*, *Smolma*, *Dimsyl*, *Miyah*, and *Captain Jack*. The airship is flying on a skeleton crew, manned only by *Captain Jack*, *Smolma*, and *Umryn*, with necessary help by the others as directed by those with more experience.

As the airship takes flight, *Capitain Jack* requests *Umryn* check on the arcane flight cylinders and *Smolma* check the condition of the main deck.  These checks will give the party a rough idea of the airship's status. These refer to a Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 10 and Wisdom (Perception) check DC 10.
> The *Enbridge III* is in relatively good condition [200 HP] and arcane flight cylinders are functional, though only operating at 60% because they hadn't been fully re-implemented after the kobold attack.

As the flight begins, the party can interact with each other and *Miyah* while *Captain Jack* operates the wheel. 
> *Miyah* is excited to talk about her father, *Stormclaw*, who presumably worked as the leader of a mercenary group called the *Wild Things* during the *Throne Wars*. She has a few different stories written down in a leather journal that she keeps on her.

**Stormclaw's Many Battles**
- The Battle of Gaithen-il-Dein
	- A famous battle between Carantania and Tairia, in which *General Manwildur* was finally and officially defeated by the high elven forces.
- The Battle of Bramblerock
	- A well-known battle between Carantania and Zhou along the southern border between the two states.
- The Battle of Barrow-Downs
	- A battle along the eastern border of Carantania, near the Tairia border. Known mostly for the destruction of Fort Condor, an old military base in Carantania.

> A few hours into the flight, the party flies past *Blackstone Keep*, and *Captain Jack* requests a magic-user attempt to use the *Sending Stone* in the airship's communication's quarters to reach out and let them know that *Enbridge III* is passing through on a diplomatic mission.  The *Sending Stone* requires a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 14 to operate. Failure to do so causes the *Sending Stone* to simply not respond to the channel.


> In either case, the *Sending Stone* receives a message as the airship passes by from someone identified as *Regiment Officer Cantebry*, who tells the ship to land near *Blackstone Keep* immediately for an inspection, before continuing further into *Carantania*.  *Captain Jack* advises against doing this, as the bueracracy will likely leave the party without enough time to complete their investigation.


> If the party is not able to convince the officer that they must pass through unobstructed, they are warned that there will be immediate repurcussions. The tower of Blackstone Keep then begins to glow bright blue, before unleashing a wave of arcane energy, which immediately shuts down and dispels magical implements. This results in the immediate shutdown of the arcane flight cylinders, and the airship falls into freefall.
