## Wedding of a New Age
> Kastron and Tairia are entering into a new alliance with the marriage of Aelonwyn Teskavold and Cielennen Featherwords. The date has arrived and it is time for a glorious new age of peace and prosperity!

### The Adventure
The ceremony between Aelonwyn and Cielennen will begin as normal, but at the moment of the vow exchange the service is interrupted by a powerful sorcerer known as *Ciphel Orgus*, an agent of **Bahadur, the Black**. Ciphel is angered that the Teskavold's are renouncing their devotion to the Black Dragon and turning side to the Gold Dragons, per the marriage proposal. He gives the wedding party a choice to renounce the marriage before using the *Staff of Unsung Sorrows* to sap the souls of all those in the wedding. A counterspell releases the partial souls of the players. *Ciphel Orgus* flees the wedding, taking with him the souls of the bride, groom, and entire wedding party.

### The Hook
*Rinaela*, a young, gold drake acolyte, through her counterspell, saves the partial souls of the party. Through *Rinaela*, they learn that **Synvalla, the Gold** can restore their souls if they can retrieve the *Staff of Unsung Sorrows* from *Ciphel Orgus*. Through this, they can also revive the bride, groom, and wedding party, allowing the ceremony to be completed.

#### Where to go from here?
*Ciphel Orgus* is a bit of a wildcard to the Black Dragons and only protected by his faith. *The Staff of Unsung Sorrows* had previously thought to have been lost during the Throne Wars. Questions the players may want to investigate could include:

- How was *Ciphel Orgus* able to get into and out of the wedding?
- Why does *Ciphel Orgus* not want the Teskavold's to denounce their faith in the Black Dragon Lord?
- Who, if anyone, is working with *Ciphel Orgus*?
- How did *Ciphel Orgus* get his hands on the *Staff of Unsung Sorrows*?
- Where had the *Staff of Unsung Sorrows* been all this time?
- What are the ramifications of having only part of a soul?
- Are there other methods of restoring their souls?
- Is it possible to face *Ciphel Orgus* head-on or should they approach this another way?

Having a rough idea of how to answer these questions, or where the party can go to answer them, should help lead the DM to which direction the adventure will lead next time.
