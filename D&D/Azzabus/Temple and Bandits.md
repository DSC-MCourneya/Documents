### The Temple
> Headed by Ferrus Baulgaus, the Temple of the Gold Dragon is a safe haven in the heart of Shorna. Willing to take the players in and grant Aelonwynn and Cielennen a place to rest while the players figure out their next move, the priests of the Temple offer guidance on what to do next.

Ferrus is able to provide the players with a few useful bits of information:

- *Ciphel Orgus* is a wildcard amongst Black Dragons, and operates independently of direction from *Bahadur, the Black*. He believes in *pure blood*, meaning that those of black dragon lineage and allegiance cannot mix with the other, impure races.
- *Ciphel Orgus*' last known hideout was the *Caverns of Ire*, tucked away near *Cobalt Point* in *Carantania*. It has been some time since he was last seen, however.
- The *Staff of Unsung Sorrows* was a forbidden artifact locked away in the *Temple of Murking Mire* in the *Bellow Swamps* of eastern *Tairia*. It was locked away by *Xyr, the Purple* when it was believed to have been used against her brood during the Throne Wars. How and why it came to end up in the possession of *Ciphel Orgus* is anyone's guess.
- *Ciphel Orgus* is famously fervently anti-artifice, seeing it as a bastardization of magic. It is a way of *allowing the lower races to wield powers that should be beyond their control*. The fact that artifice was used during his attack is noteworthy.

If the players intend to fly out of Shorna in an attempt to head in a direction for more information, they'll need to find *Captain Jack* first. He has the magical sigil needed to launch the airship embedded into his right hand, but has been missing since the airship docked yesterday.

Players can Investigate (DC 13) to find information on *Captain Jack*. Local guards say he is currently being saught after for a parking violation, but that should hardly be a reason to be in hiding. *Miyah Spinebreaker*, a tabaxi shopkeep, saw the Captain Jack the previous day. Her shop was left in ruins when a group of rough looking men came and stole him away. She said the men had tattoos that looked strikingly similar to the logo of an old bar on the edge of Shorna's Market District that has been shut down for a year or so.
