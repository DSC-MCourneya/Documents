# Group ARG Game
### Rules for Design
**1.** There are four Races, Classes, and eight different Backstories.

**2.** Each player has a single character. This character is a combination of one race, one job, and one backstory.

**3.** Each race/job combination must be unique overall. E.g. only one Dwarf Scholar may exist.

**4.** Real-world references and clues must be static or direct references.  In a scenario where, say, a book reference is used, the exact ISBN must be used so that different versions of the same book don't cause issues.

### The In-Game Universe
*Eight individuals have awoken on the floor of what appears to be the basement of an office building. On the floor underneath each person is a single piece of a much larger drawing that connects to make what appears to be some kind of cult-like symbology.*

The Races Available are: Mord'in, Elesyn, Vesper, and Mi'naa
The Jobs Available are: Security, Devout, Hacker, Dealer

### Races
#### Mord'in
*The stout and fiercely loyal Mord'in are commonly referred to as Dwarves by the ilk of human society. Their name means **people of Mord**. Because they are inherently hardier than most other races, they find themselves largely in physically intensive jobs, though such a calling does not find its way to all Mord'in.*

**Racial Traits**
- Can Read / Write in *Mord'gith* language
- Can Read / Write in *Common* language
- Immune to the effects of extreme temperatures (cold and heat)

#### Elesyn
*Small of stature and witty in nature, the Elesyn are commonly called elves or pixies by human society. Usually no more than half a foot in height, these winged people often dabble in either trickery or scholarly trades, though some find time to do a little of both. They can be exceptionally strong for their build, often able to carry loads similar to that of a human boy of ten or so years.*

**Racial Traits**
- Can Read / Write in *Gaelic celtic* language
- Can Read / Write in *Common* language
- Can See / Operate *Aetheric* runography
- Immune to *Aetheric* effects, such as mind-control and sleep induction

#### Vesper
*The vesper are a race that has no word that is directly translatable to our common tongue for themselves.  They are malgamations of undirected spiritual energy that has amalgamated into humanoid form. These forms then re-introduce into society and largely only act. They appear to be able to directly communicate with each other, but have no capacity for speech. They have largely been used by as a labor force by human society and accept a wage, though it is largely unknown what their purpose for money would be.*

**Racial Traits**
- Can communicate with other Vespers using a form of ESP in a language unknown by other races
- Can Read / Understand the *Common* language, though cannot speak it
- Can *meld* with active *Aetheric currents*, essentially allowing them to *read magic* by touch, assuming that current is not actively being blocked by another force.

#### Mi'naa
*The agile and slender Mi'naa are often called catfolk by human society, and their limber nature lends well to that name. They make up a wide variety of the social structure, ranging from CEO to drug dealers. They are often stronger than their human counterparts and nearly always faster, though their fast-paced lives leave many behind intellectually. A Mi'naa is more likely to have a job focused on agility and strength than one of charisma or mind, though this is obviously not always the case.*

**Racial Traits**
- Can Read / Write in *Mi'vaer* language
- Can Read / Write in *Common* language
- Can climb walls that aren't specifically designed to prevent it
- Can see even in pitch blackness
