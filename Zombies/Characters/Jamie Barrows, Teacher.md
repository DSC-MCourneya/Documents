In other situations not covered by *Surprise* rules, *Danger Sense* provides a *Notice* roll with a -2 penalty (or +2 if *Notice* would normally be allowed) to detect the hazard and take appropriate action.  If this was an attack and Jamie makes his *Notice* roll, the foes doesn't get *The Drop* on them.
