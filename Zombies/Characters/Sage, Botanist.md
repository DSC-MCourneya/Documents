> Prior to the Rapture, Sage was on their way to assistant manager at the local greenhouse. They sold cannabis on the side to earn extra income and slowly this became much of their personality. Sage is known to often mention the positives of growing and partaking, almost always in the tone of a salesperson.

## Traits
*Pace* : 6
*Parry* : 2
*Toughness* : 5 (1)

## Hinderances
*Perfectionist (Major)* - When a plan of action is in place, Sage has a strong urge to see it to perfect completion, often to the detriment of their safety.

*Tongue-tied (Major)* - Sage often flubs their speech when it matters. Stuttering through a cool one-liner (or thinking of them afterward!), going off on a tangent when trying to explain something, and generally miscommunicating are common for Sage. They take a -1 penalty when attempting *Intimidation*, *Performance*, *Persuasion*, and *Taunt* rolls that involve speech.

## Edges
*Charismatic* - Sage is likeable and often exudes goodwill and confidence. Knowing how to care for and distribute cannabis also helps.

*Luck* - Sage seems best by fate, karma, the gods, or cannabis. They draw one extra benny at the beginning at the beginning of the game session.

*Scavenger* - Once per encounter the hero may find, "suddenly remember", or dig up some much-needed piece of equipment, a handful of ammunition, or some other useful device.
