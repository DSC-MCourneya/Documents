### Creation Rules
##### Race
- Each character has a custom designed race that is as close to a direct translation of their 5e equivalent as was possible. The player can choose a different race, as well, if preferred, or work with the GM to alter the existing race in some way.

##### Hindrances
- Each character can take up to 4 Points worth of Hindrances. Minor Hindrances are worth 1 Point and Major Hindrances are worth 2 Points. These *Hindrance Points* can be spent a few ways. Unless otherwise noted, all benefits gained from spending *Hindrance Points* can be stacked (e.g. you can pick Double your Starting Funds four times, if preferred).
- **Spend 2 Hindrance Points:**
	- Raise an Attribute one die type, or
	- Choose an Edge
- **Spend 1 Hindrance Point:**
	- Gain an additional Skill point, or
	- Double your starting funds

##### Traits
- Each character has a combination of Attributes and Skills that define what the character excels in. These are the core of your character's capabilities.
- All characters, unless otherwise changed by Race, Hindrance or Edge, start with a d4 in *Athletics*, *Common Knowledge*, *Notice*, *Persuasion*, and *Stealth*. These are called Core Skills and all characters have them in this campaign setting.
- All characters, unless otherwise changed by Race, Hindrance or Edge, start with a d4 in all Attributes.
- Players start with 5 Attribute Points, which can be spent to increase one attribute by one die. For example, increasing *Agility* from d4 to d6 costs 1 Attribute Point.
- Players start with 12 Skill Points, which can be used to increase Skills by one die type, or purchase them as a d4 skill if the character does not already have the skill. If you want to increase a skill beyond the die type of the skill's associated Attribute, it costs 2 Skill Points for each step.c
	- For example, Don Quixote has a d6 Agility. He takes Fighting as his first choice, which costs him 1 Skill Point. Now that he has d4 Fighting, he can spend 1 point to increase it to d6, since Fighting is an Agility-based skill. However, if he wants to increase it to d8 Fighting, it will cost 2 Skill Points, since his Agility is only a d6. It would cost him an additional 2 Skill Points to increase his Fighting from d8 to d10.
- Skills may not be increased beyond d12, unless otherwise noted. Additional increases beyond d12 provide a stacking +1 bonus until reaching that skills maximum. By default, no skills have this stacking bonus, it is usually defined by a character's Race or Edges.

##### Derived Statistics
- **Pace**: How fast your character moves. In this setting, we associate 1 Pace to 5' or 1 square on a battlemat. Pace is *6* by default, modified only by Hindrances, Edges, and Races.
- **Parry:** Your ability to naturally resist Fighting checks made against you. If the enemy's Fighting check is below your Parry, their attack is avoided. Parry is equal to 2 + half your Fighting die, plus any bonuses for Shields or certain weapons. If you do not have Fighting, your Parry is 2 + shield / equipment bonuses. If you have a bonus to Fighting, such as d12 + 1, you add half the bonus modifier, rounded down. So d12 + 1 results in a Parry of 8, while d12 + 2 results in a Parry of 9.
- **Toughness:** Your hero's ability to resist damage. You may be hit by the enemy, but they may still not deal damage. Damage rolls must meet or exceed your Toughness in order to cause harm. Toughness is equal to 2 + half your Vigor, plus Armor worn on your Torso. Use bonus modifier rules similar to those outlined in *Parry* above.

##### Edges
- You can choose a number of Edges equal to your Hindrance Points divided by 2, assuming you don't spend those points on other items.

##### Gear
- All characters start with 500 Gold to purchase equipment. In this setting, we will be starting with an additional 500 Gold per character.

##### Powers
- All characters who take an Arcane Background edge will craft powers with the GM based on the number of Powers that specific Arcane Background starts with.

##### Handling Advances
Once the previous steps are completed, these characters will be starting with 4 Advances in place. This will open up a few options and allow your characters to be considered *Seasoned*.  Only the fourth Advance is considered a *Seasoned* advance, so if you are looking to nab some *Seasoned*-ranked Powers, you should choose the *New Powers* edge for this Advance.

For each *Advance*, you can do one of the following:

- Gain a new Edge
- Increase a Skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute die by one type.
- Increase two Skills that are less than their linked attribute by one type (or increase a single skill twice, as long as both increases occur below the attribute's die).
- Increase one Attribute by a die type. This option may only be chosen *once* per Rank. *Legendary* heroes by increase an Attribute every other Advance.
- Permanently remove a Minor Hindrance or reduce a Major Hindrance to a Minor (if possible). This should be done with the GM and have a plausible, in-universe explanation for occuring. A Doubting Thomas that has just finished another dungeon infested with ethereal ghosts and ghouls may have a hard time continuing to deny the existence of the supernatural, but the hero who Can't Swim but hasn't been anywhere near water to practice might find it harder to remove that Hindrance.

Feel free to use the area below to place your picks for Advances. Each cell shows the Advancement number, as well as the Rank it is associated to.

Advancement | Rank | I Want To...
------------|------|-------------
1 | Novice | 
2 | Novice | 
3 | Novice | 
4 | Seasoned |
