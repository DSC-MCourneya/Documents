![Image|400x300](UndeadKobold.jpg)

> Crudely taking the shape of a kobold, this mass of flesh, scales, claws, and fangs hisses and growls with an unnaturally low tone for the creature it is supposed to be. Sockets where eyes should be, dislocated jaws, and large chunks of flesh or scales missing, the creature otherwise moves and acts similar to its living counterpart.
