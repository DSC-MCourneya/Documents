> These creatures have an eggshell white skin with a coating of thick, burgundy scales over their arms, legs, and back. Large, pointed ears jut out from a sickly thin, bony face and jaw that houses small, glowing amber eyes and rows of sharpened teeth. Their hands end in long, talon-like claws that are stained with soil and blood. They skitter about quickly, almost without sound, but stops and tilts its head toward the slightest pin drop.

##### <u>**Description**</u>
Gibbins are the bottom-feeders of Underside. They attack and feed on anything that comes within range and vaguely smells of flesh. These creatures are not intelligent and possess no true communication skills. They may attack alone or in packs, though they do not generally organize.
