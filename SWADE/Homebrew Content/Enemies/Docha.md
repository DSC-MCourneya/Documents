![Image|300x400](Docha.jpg)

> Standing nearly eight feet tall, this creature has the vague form of a man. Their face is gaunt, the skin pulled tight and nearly skeletal. A brimmed had rests on their head, covering their eye sockets with shadow. A heavy, black trench coat covers the majority of their body, with only thing, clawed fingers protruding from underneath. Their legs and feet are veiled beneath the coat, though they almost appear to glide over the ground, rather than walk. The area around this creature is unsettling silent and fetid. You immediately feel unease when it is near.

#### Powers (PP: 12)
##### ***Fetid Ambience***
> The air around the Docha puts you at unease, dropping your guard and making you vulnerable and more easily frightened.

**Mana Cost**: 3
**Range**: Smarts x 2 (centered on caster)
**Duration**: 5

*Fetid Unease* causes all creatures that end their turn within range to be forced to make a *Vigor Test* against the Docha's Spellcasting. Failing the Test results in being *Shaken*. Raises have no effect on this power.

##### ***Smokescreen***
> A thick cloud of black emanates from the creature, veiling the area and swallowing all light in its reach.

**Mana Cost**: 4
**Range**: Smarts x 2 (centered on caster)
**Duration**: 5

*Smokescreen* grants the Docha *near total cover* for its duration. All creatures within the smoke also gain this benefit. On a raise, the smoke becomes so cold, it causes creatures that require to breath to suffer 2d6 cold damage if they end their turn within the smoke.

##### <u>**Description**</u>
*Docha* are dark spirits in Underside that serve as guides to wayward souls. They are often dismissive or defensive of living beings, as they are often in Underside to extract souls for any number or reasons, disrupting the flow of life and death. *Docha* are creatures directly tapped into the *Leylines* of the world, and as such, are extremely sensitive to spellcasting manipulation.
