> Skin colored gray-green, matted hair, snake-like yellow eyes, and sharp teeth are the hallmarks of the Goblins. They travel in packs and attack in groups to overwhelm larger opponents. They are smart enough to craft and wield rudimentary weapons, but generally not intelligent enough to craft their own armor.

##### <u>**Description**</u>
Goblins tend to attack in groups of 3-8, ganging up on opponents to stack their attack bonus. They speak to each other in a rough, almost unrecognizable version of the Orc language in their scratchy, garbled voices. Goblins are hoarders naturally, and love to collect items that they see of value, which may not have any significance to other races.
