> Darkness and shadow seep from around you, weaving their way up your body and into your hand, where the gloom solidifies into a black blade of emanating energy. Its outline faintly glows royal purple.

Gloom Blade summons a dark blade into the hand of the caster. If the caster loses the weapon or is disarmed, they can use their free action to summon the blade back to their hand. The blade summoned is by default a shortsword, though it can be changed to other blades using Modifiers. The caster summons a shadow dagger for each raise that instantly attacks a target of the caster's choice. This attack is treated as a standard ranged spell attack and deals Str+d4 Darkness damage if the attack hits.

<u>**Modifiers**</u>
- **Longsword (+1):** Blade is summoned as a longsword (Str + d8 Darkness damage) instead of a shortsword.
- **Greatsword (+2):** Blade is summoned as a greatsword (Str + d10 Darkness damage) instead of a shortsword. The greatsword can only be wielded with two hands.
