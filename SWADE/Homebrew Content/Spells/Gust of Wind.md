##### *Gust of Wind*
> A surge of air bursts forth from the caster, pushing all creatures in the direction pointed away from them.

Rank: Novice
Mana Cost: 1
Range: Smarts
Duration: 5

Gust of Wind moves a powerful blast of air from behind the caster in the direction of their open palm. Gust of Wind can also be used with Modifiers to blow with less force to do things such as snuff a candle or torch, or cool someone off.  If resisted, Gust of Air pushes with a force of Str + d6 (Str + d8 on a raise). The resisting target makes an opposed roll and is pushed back half their Pace on a failure.

Gust of Wind requires air to be present to be manipulated, so it cannot be used in environments where gaseous air is not inherently present (underwater, for example). Gust of Wind does not *create* air. The force of wind remains in place for the duration of the spell, and creatures attempting to move through it must spend double their Pace to push against it on a successful resistance.

<u>**Modifiers**</u>
- **Small (+0):** The winds created are much smaller and harder to notice. They can be used to do things such as fan fires or snuff small flames (such as candles or torches).
