Mage Armor coats the caster in magical energy, granting them additional armor for the duration of the spell. The caster gains +2 Armor or +4 on a raise. Mage Armor stacks with all other armor, natural or worn, and is negated by Armor Piercing as usual.

<u>**Modifiers**</u>
- **Additional Recipient (+1):** Ethereal armor may affect an additional target for 1 additional mana each.
- **Greater Armor (+1):** Success grants 4 points of armor (+6 with a raise).
- **Toughness (+1):** Ethereal armor hardens the target's skin and bones, providing *Toughness* instead of *Armor* and is not affected by Armor Piercing.
