##### Elysium Elf
> The warrior tribes of Elysium are known for their strenght and cunning in combat. Though they engage in light diplomacy and trade with other races, they tend to keep to themselves in familiar territories. Though not inept in magic, Elysium elves tend to shy away from honing their abilities in the arcane, viewing it as a form of curse or dark pact.

Elysium elves are generally copper and dark toned, though there are instances of light-skinned among them. Their hair is often wild to those from outside their territories, ranging all colors of the spectrum, but tend to allow them to blend into the brilliantly colored megafauna common in their lands. Unlike their High Elf cousins, Elysium elves tend to live only a few hundred years due to their harsher lifestyles.

- **Night Watcher's Eyes:** Elysium elves are keen at hunting in darkness. They ignore penalties associated to Dim and Dark Illumination (but not Pitch Darkness).
- **Afraid of the Dark Pact:** Those who are gifted with the curse often live with the weight of their brethren's fears on their shoulders. Elysium elves take a -2 penalty to Spirit checks.
