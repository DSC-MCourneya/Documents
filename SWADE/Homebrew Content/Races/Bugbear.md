##### Bugbear
> A cousin of the Goblinoid family, the Bugbear is a large creature of brute strength, and often overlooked in any of their other features. Crafty and often natural leaders, Bugbears are often the head of goblin tribes, but also earn that position.

Bugbears can be fiery, fierce warrior types that leave all conversation to the end of their blades. They are also just as often spiritual elders and mediators. They are generally bulkier than other races and have thick fur that covers much of their body, though not usually their entire body in the way the Tabaxi are coated.

- **Brutal Strength:** Bugbears are naturally strong and start with a d6 in Strength, increasing their maximum to a d12 + 1.
- **Adaptable:** Bugbears are more clever than most give them credit for. They often have to fend for themselves and learn how to best navigate the world they are born into. They gain one free Novice Edge of their choice (and must meet the requirements of that Edge).
- **Dark Vision:** Bugbears have eyes that have adapted to the dark after years of goblinoid cave living. They do not take penalties for Dim and Dark illuminations (but are still affected by Pitch Darkness).
- **Stranger In the World:** Bugbears inherently gain the *Outside* hinderence. They are often seen as others in society, rather than the norm.
